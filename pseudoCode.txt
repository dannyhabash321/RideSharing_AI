This psuedocode represents the algorithm needed to 
plan the route for dropping off passengers in each vehicle.
This algorithm is called after the closest vehicle has been assigned to the passenger
This algorithm prioritizes pickups over dropoffs and will not dropoff any passenegers unless they are on the path to a pickup
This algorithm calculates shortest path to pickUp then after all pickups are done, shortest path to dropoffs

pseudo Code:


function pathPriority ( vehicle ){
    
    initialize shortestPath to 200 nodes
    
    if there are any pickUps in the vehicle pickUps list:
        
        for every pickUp in vehicle's pickUps list:
        
            path = shortest path to that pickup
        
            if the length of path is less than shortestPath:
                update shortestPath to path

        set vehicle path to shortestPath
    
    if all pickups are done, calculate shortest route
    
        for every passengers' dropoff in vehicle.dropOffs:
            
            path = shortest path from current node to passengers' dropOff
            
            if this passengers' path is shorter than shortestPath:
                update shortestPath to path
            
        set vehicle path to shortestPath
